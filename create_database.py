# For our image search engine, weâ€™ll be utilizing a 3D color histogram in the HSV color space with 8 bins for the Hue channel, 12 bins for the saturation channel, and 3 bins for the value channel, yielding a total feature vector of dimension 8 x 12 x 3 = 288.
# This means that for every image in our dataset, no matter if the image is 36 x 36 pixels or 2000 x 1800 pixels, all images will be abstractly represented and quantified using only a list of 288 floating point numbers.
